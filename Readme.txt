The proposed work is a low cost maritime security model, which is mainly focused on the small-scale fishermen.
The proposed system includes measuring the distance traversed by the model boat from the server control room.
Live data is recorded by the servers. The distance of the boat with respect to the border is calculated using 
the signal strength.  The information pertaining to crossed boat is sent to control room of the port as well as
to the fishermen. PIC microcontroller is the first RISC based microcontroller fabricated in CMOS that uses separate
bus for instruction and data allowing simultaneous access of program and data memory. The technology used in PIC 
16F877 is flash memory, so that data is retained even when the power is off. Easy programming and erasing are other 
features of PIC 16F877. RSSI technology is used to measure distance travelled beyond its border and to provide the 
alert for the fishermen travelling in the respective boats. This security alert system comprises with Transmitting 
unit, which consist of all information and connects with alert system. The system also consists of wireless sensors 
and a processing unit, which estimates the exact position of the vessel by using the localization algorithm.
